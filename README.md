**Project Showcase: Analyzing USA Housing Sales with Tableau**

Passionate about data, I embarked on a journey to uncover the dynamics of the USA housing market using the robust visualization capabilities of Tableau. This project offers valuable insights into housing sales, employing various visualization techniques to paint a comprehensive picture of the real estate landscape.

**Visualizing Property Essentials:**
Utilizing Tableau's versatile features, I crafted insightful histograms revealing the distribution of bathrooms and bedrooms in the USA housing market. These visualizations provide a nuanced understanding of real estate preferences and trends, empowering stakeholders with actionable insights.

**Heat Map Exploration:**
I developed a dynamic heat map showcasing the concentration of housing sales in different regions. This visually striking representation enhances comprehension of regional variations in the market, facilitating quick insights into hotspots and trends.
